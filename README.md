# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Project: Multi User Blog

A multi-user blog built in Python 2.7 on Google Cloud's Google App Engine. This project features the webapp2 python web framework, jinja2 templating system, and Google Cloud's Datastore API. In addition, I have chosen to also use the following library/frameworks:

-[Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) - Python implementation of the Markdown markup language for richer text.  
-[py-bcrypt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-bcrypt/0.4) - A hashing library for secure passwords  
-[jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) - Javascript library for quick and easy DOM manipulation and event handling  
-[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework for quick and easy basic grid layout and css elements
